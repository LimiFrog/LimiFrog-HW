
This directory contains 3D-printable models of protective cases for LimiFrog.


The models were built using the Openscad modelling software (can be freely downloaded on the web).
File LimiFrog-0.2-Case-Model.scad is the OpenScad source file.

Files Model_xxx.stl are all derived from this master source file, using different settings for wall thickness and presence/absence of some features.
File Case_Models.pdf lists the available variants.

You may also create your own variants by tinkering with the Openscad source file.

The STL format is suitable for usage with any 3D-printer or to send to on-line 3D printing services.
There are free STL viewers available on-line if you want to view the proposed cases (

The choice of wall thickness depends on the capabilities of the target 3D printer and on the required robustness and rigidity of the printed case.


It is possible to use a wall thickness of 1mm to print this case using Sculteo's online 3D-printing services, in basic white plastic (it's nylon, actually). The result is slightly flexible and reasonably robust  (although but not fit to sustain severe stress).
I have also used 1mm to print in ABS on a professional machine from a local 3D-printing specialist.
For DIY 3D-printers, 1.5 or 2mm thickness may be more appropriate.
